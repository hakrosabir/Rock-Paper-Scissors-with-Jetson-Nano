![poster.png](img/poster.png)
You can try the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. 

## File

### `collection.ipynb`
Data collection for the rock-paper-scissor hand gestures.

### `train_model.ipynb`
Train the model with the data collected.

### `test_game.ipynb`
Code for testing gameplay process. This code is a simplified version of `game.ipynb`, the GPIO part indicating the device's choice of Rock/Paper/Scissor is removed. 

Try running this file before `game.ipynb` when you clone this project.

### `game.ipynb`
Code for actual gameplay process, including GPIO lights and buttons. 

During the gameplay, the trained model is used to recognize the hand gesture of the player.

## Demo

### Prepare the train model
Open the "train_model.ipynb". 

Run all the cells in order.

If you run all the cells, you would get best_model.pth.

â€»You don't need to do this process every time.

### Play the Rock-Paper-Scissors game 
Open the "test_game.ipynb". 

Run all the cells in order.

You can play the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
